Full description at: https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Homework/tree/main/3-UsingAPIs/Week1#exercise-4-throw-the-dice-for-a-poker-dice-game

For this exercise you should do the following:
  - Refactor the `rollDice()` function to throw five dice in one go, by 
    using `.map()` on the `dice` array to create an array of promises for use 
    with `Promise.all()`.
  - A successful (i.e. resolved) throw should output a message similar to: 
      Resolved! [ 'JACK', 'QUEEN', 'QUEEN', 'NINE', 'JACK' ]
  - An unsuccessful (i.e. rejected) throw should output a message similar to:
      Rejected! Die 3 rolled off the table.

The provided rollDie() function logs the value of a die as it rolls, 
time-stamped with the time of day (with millisecond accuracy) to the console. 
Once you have successfully completed this exercise you will notice that the 
intermediate messages are output in bursts of up to five at a time as the dice 
finish rolling asynchronously.

You may also notice that, in the case of a rejected promise, dice that have not
yet finished their roll continue to do so. 
Can you explain why? Please add your answer as a comment to the end of the 
exercise file.

// The line below makes the rollDie() function available to this file.
// Do not change or remove it.
const rollDie = require('../../helpers/pokerDiceRoller');

function rollDice() {
  const dice = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Map each die number to a promise returned by rollDie
  const promises = dice.map((dieNumber) => rollDie(dieNumber));

  // Return a promise that resolves when all dice have settled
  return Promise.all(promises);
}

function main() {
  rollDice()
    .then((results) => console.log('Resolved!', results))
    .catch((error) => console.log('Rejected!', error.message));
}
// The asynchronous behavior can be observed in the rollDie function. When a die is rolled, it uses setTimeout to simulate the rolling process asynchronously. The setTimeout function schedules the next roll, and it continues independently, even if one die rolls off the table (rejected promise)

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test') {
  main();
}
module.exports = rollDice;
